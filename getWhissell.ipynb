    "This is a program to calculate the Whissell values for a string of text around a particular target word. That means finding the word, getting the # words before and behind, replacing them with the Whissel Dictionary numbers, then averaging them. To use on your text, change the variables to your desired text location, target word, and target window size (the window size is actually half the length of the full window size). I use the text of The Waves because I already have it. I used WordSmith Tools to doublecheck concordance accuracy and context accuracy. The re.sub routines first save out text and apostrophes, then remove apostrophes (single quotes) preceded or followed by a space. Thus only apostrophes inside words remain. This is important for The Waves but might need fiddling for other texts. "

    "Next step is to display values for each word plotted over the book. We follow her methodology as first guesstimate. \"The mean of all values for a sample characterizes the sample as a whole\" (Whissell 2009, 515). She takes the mean for all word sets involved. For _Much Ado about Nothing_ she takes total speeches from each character (p. 516) and compares values to compare characters. In her other test she examines a police-involved shooting in Ireland, the speech of the shooter and of the later police report. There she focuses on the extreme ends of the emotion scales, and the method is not quite clear. She refers to a 2007 article on \"Ruth\" that clarifies nothing--she compares to \"normative\" numbers of strong emotion words in her 1998 corpus but does not provide those numbers anywhere that I found. \n",

    "Adjustment: plt.plot by itself adjusts display axis to data. This makes comparing graphs impossible. So we will fix the y-axis values so every display is comparable. Max val is 3, min is 1. ee has highest mean. This means the max value of 3-1.85=1.15, min val is 1-1.85=-0.85. ii has smallest mean--3-1.525=1.475, min is 1-1.525=-0.525. Thus max ii and min ee should set the scale. In practice, though, no display gets to those extremes because of the effects of function words. So we will arbitrarily go with -0.5 and 1. If vals go off the charts somewhere we will change it."
